# LuaChip8
A Chip-8 emulator implemented in lua and love2d

This readme contains a brief overview over the project and the changes since the last versions. Contact me personally for in-depth details on version changes.

Running this project
--------------------

The folder 'versions' always contains a out-the-box executable for Windows/Linux and the platform indepened .love file. 

Please note that if for some reason the executable doesn't work for your machine or you want to participate in this project 
you need a working Lua5.1 environment and have love2d, the game engine, installed.
More about ths topic can be found under "Getting Started" at the love2d wiki [https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started].

Missing Features
----------------

This emulator is on it's own more or less finished. But there is always room for more features! 
Some new features could be:

- Figuring out why 'Rush Hour' always breaks mid-way
- English language support (or everything else except german)
- More sound?
- ...
